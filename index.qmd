# Introduction to LLMs and tool calling

*Is it magic, or not so magic after all?*

## What are LLMs?

- LLM = Large Language Model
- Trained on huge amounts of text data
- Designed to predict and generate human-like language

<br>

All powered by a model that recognises patterns at scale. 

## How do LLMs work?

The answer is quite boring: statistics. 

![](images/shiny-side-of-llms-stats.png)

## The magic of scale

And something cool happens when you train a model on massive datasets with billions of words: LLMs start to show **emergent abilities**, aka skills the model wasn't directly trained for, yet still manages to do.

<br>

An LLM was trained to predict the next word in a sentence, but at scale it can also:

- Write code
- Translate languages
- Do fun things like writing poetry or jokes

## What are LLMs good at?

LLMs are great at:

- Generating human-like text
- Providing conversational responses
- Summarising text
- Answering questions based on provided context
- Writing and debugging code snippets

## What are LLMs bad at?

It isn't all rainbows and unicorns though. 

<br>

LLMs can be confidently wrong. They can "hallucinate" information, making up facts or details that aren't true:

- Counting
- Performing calculations
- Providing real-time or up-to-date information

## Why do LLMs hallucinate?

LLMs generate text based on patterns in the data they were trained on. 

<br>

They don't have a true understanding of the world or access to real-time information.

<br>

So, when asked a question outside their training data, they might produce plausible-sounding but incorrect answers.

## LLMs don't execute code

LLMs can generate code snippets, but they don't actually run or test the code.

- If we ask an LLM to write a function, it might produce code that looks correct but isn't.
- If we ask an LLM to perform calculations, it might give us the wrong answer because it's generating text based on patterns rather than executing mathematical operations.
- If we ask for real-time data, like the current weather, it can't provide accurate information because it doesn't have access to live data.

## But we know how to be accurate

What if we could combine the strengths of LLMs with tools that provide accurate information? Real functions that get executed?

<br>

Hello, **tool calling**!

## What is tool calling?

Tool calling is a technique where an LLM can invoke external tools or functions to perform specific tasks.

<br>

For example: a tool that fetches real-time weather data. When the LLM is asked about the weather, it can **call this tool** to get accurate information instead of guessing.

<br>

Or, we can create a tool that performs calculations. When the LLM is asked a math question, it can **call this tool** to get the correct answer.

## Benefits of tool calling

- **Accuracy**: tools provide reliable and up-to-date information
- **Specialisation**: tools can be designed for specific tasks
- **Efficiency**: LLMs can focus on generating text while tools handle other stuff
- **Reduced hallucination**: by relying on tools for factual information, the chances of LLMs making things up decrease

## How?

With `ellmer` 💜

# Using ellmer for tool calling in R
*ellmer makes it easy to use LLMs from R, with built-in support for tool/function calling.*

## What do you need?

In R, environment variables are typically stored in a `.Renviron` file. You can create this file in your project root or in your home directory `(~/.Renviron)`. Or, use `usethis::edit_r_environ()`.

```{.r}
# .Renviron
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your_anthropic_api_key_here"
```
<br>

Install `ellmer` from CRAN:

```{.r}
install.packages("ellmer")
```

## Your first conversation

```{.r}
library(ellmer)

chat <- chat("claude/claude-sonnet-4-5")

chat$chat(
  "Can you tell me some fun things to do with an 11 month old baby?"
)
```

## Your first conversation

```{.r}
library(ellmer)

chat <- chat("claude/claude-sonnet-4-5")

chat$chat(
  "Can you tell me some fun things to do with an 11 month old baby?"
)
```

<br>

```{.md}
# Sure! Here are some fun activities you can do with your 11-month-old baby:
1. **Peek-a-Boo**: This classic game never gets old! Hide your face behind your hands or a cloth and then reveal it with a big smile. Your baby will love the surprise!
2. **Sensory Play**: Create a sensory bin with safe items like soft fabrics, plastic spoons, and colorful balls. Let your baby explore different textures and shapes.
3. **Music and Dance**: Play some upbeat music and dance around with your baby. Sing simple songs and encourage your baby to clap or move to the rhythm.
4. **Stacking Blocks**: Provide your baby with soft blocks or stacking cups. Show them how to stack and knock them down. This helps with hand-eye coordination.
5. **Reading Time**: Choose colorful board books with simple pictures and read to your baby. Point to the images and make sounds to keep them engaged.
6. **Outdoor Exploration**: Take your baby for a walk in a stroller or carrier. Point out different sights, sounds, and smells in nature.
7. **Water Play**: Fill a shallow basin with water and let your baby splash around with cups and toys. Always supervise closely during water play.
```

## About the `chat` object

- It's **stateful**: it keeps track of the conversation history.
- You give it a `"provider/model"` string when you create it, e.g. `"claude/claude-sonnet-4-5"`.
- You can also give it a **system prompt** to set the behaviour of the LLM.
- Optionally you can pass it `params` to tweak model settings (we won't get into that today).

## System prompt vs user prompt

- The **system prompt** is where you set the ground rules: it tells the model who it is, how it should behave, and what the answer should look like. It’s stable context.
- The **user prompt** is the specific request you make right now, like asking a question or giving a command. It’s dynamic context.

## Dynamic baby age
What if we want to make the baby age dynamic, so we can use the same prompt for different ages?

```{.md}
You are an assistant that helps parents by generating a list of 10 baby
activities appropriate for a {{ age }} month old baby. Each activity must
include a 'fun score', estimated duration in minutes, and a short description.
```

<br>

```{.r}
age <- 11
prompt_file <- "baby-activities-system-prompt-simple.md"

system_prompt <- interpolate_file(
  prompt_file,
  age = age
)

chat <- chat("claude/claude-sonnet-4-5", system_prompt = system_prompt)

chat$chat(
  "What can I do with my baby today?"
)
```

## Some tips

- **Prompt design** is a real thing: the way you phrase your system and user prompts matters.
- Provide enough **context** for the LLM to understand what you want. The more specific, the better (generally).
- Be **specific** in your system prompt about the **format** you want the answer in.
- Format your prompts (e.g. markdown) to make it more **readable** (for you and the LLM).
- Make sure all that work doesn't get lost: store your prompt in a **separate file** under version control.

## Back to the output format

We asked the LLM to provide a list of activities with specific fields: fun score, duration, description.

<br>

We could even make it more specific by stating we want JSON, YAML, or a Markdown table.

## It works... until it doesn't

This works, but is not always reliable. The LLM might forget to include a field, or format it incorrectly (e.g. wrap output in a code block, missing comma etc). The more complex the structure, the more likely it is to mess up. The solution?

<br>

**Structured output!**

## Structured output

Structured output refers to LLMs that support structured schemas as part of the API call and not just as instructions in the prompt.

<br>

These tell the model not just what to output, but how to *constrain* the generation itself. 

<br>

The model generates a structure directly (like a JSON object or typed dictionary), and the output is guaranteed to match that structure.

## Requirements for structured output

To return structured output, we need to change two things:

- Use `chat_structured`
- Provide a type specification

## Specification

Describe the structure of the output you want:

```{.r}
data_model <- type_object(
  baby_age_months = type_integer(
    description = "The age of the baby in months."
  ),
  activities = type_array(
    description = "List of 10 suggested activities for the baby based on the weather and age.",
    type_object(
      name = type_string(description = "Short title for the activity."),
      fun_score = type_integer(
        description = "Score from 1–10 indicating how fun the activity is likely to be."
      ),
      duration_minutes = type_integer(
        description = "Estimated activity length in minutes."
      ),
      description = type_string(
        description = "One-sentence description of the activity."
      )
    )
  )
)
```

## Structured chat

```{.r}
age <- 11
prompt_file <- "baby-activities-system-prompt-simple.md"

system_prompt <- interpolate_file(
  prompt_file,
  age = age
)

chat <- chat("claude/claude-sonnet-4-5", system_prompt = system_prompt)

chat$chat_structured(
  "What can I do with my baby today?",
  type = data_model
)
```

## Next up: tool calling!

Ok nice, but not tool calling yet.

<br>

Let's say we want to suggest more specific activities, like going to the park, but only if the weather is nice. Or going to see the Eifel tower, but only if you're in Paris. 

<br>

We need to tell the model in which city we are, and what the current weather is.

## Getting real-time data

Remember, LLMs can't access real-time data on their own. We need to create tools to fetch this information for us. In `ellmer`, we can define functions that the LLM can call. For example:

```{.r}
#' Get the current weather for a given city using Open-Meteo API
#'
#' @param city The name of the city
#' @return A tibble with city, temperature in Celsius, windspeed, and weather code
get_current_weather <- function(city) {
  # Geocoding API to get latitude/longitude from city name
  geo_resp <- request("https://geocoding-api.open-meteo.com/v1/search") %>%
    req_url_query(name = city, count = 1) %>%
    req_perform() %>%
    resp_body_json()

  if (is.null(geo_resp$results)) {
    stop("City not found: ", city)
  }

  lat <- geo_resp$results[[1]]$latitude
  lon <- geo_resp$results[[1]]$longitude

  # Weather API for current weather at that location
  weather_resp <- request("https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast") %>%
    req_url_query(latitude = lat, longitude = lon, current_weather = "true") %>%
    req_perform() %>%
    resp_body_json()

  current <- weather_resp$current_weather

  return(
    tibble(
      city = city,
      temperature_c = current$temperature,
      windspeed = current$windspeed,
      weather_code = current$weathercode
    )
  )
}
```

## From function to tool
To make this function available as a tool for the LLM, we need to wrap it using `tool()`:

```{.r}
get_current_weather <- tool(
  get_current_weather,
  "Returns the current weather for a given city",
  city = type_string(
    "The name of the city for which to get the weather",
    required = TRUE
  )
```

## Register tool

... and register it:

```{.r}
chat$register_tool(get_current_weather)
```

## Other changes

Of course we also need to update our prompt, because we want to include the city. This city should be dynamic as well, and we also want to retrieve the weather based on that city:

```{.md}
You are an assistant that performs two tasks:

1. Retrieve the current weather for {{ city }}. 
   Return only the JSON results, nothing else.  
2. Generate a list of 10 baby activities appropriate for a 
   baby that's {{ age }} months old and the current weather. 
   Each activity must include a 'fun score', estimated duration 
   in minutes, and a short description.

Always respond strictly in the JSON format defined by the 
provided data model.
```

## Ready, set, go?

But... 

<br>

"Note that structured data extraction automatically disables tool calling..."

<br>

So how do we combine both?

## Two step process

1. First, we call the tool to get the current weather.
2. Then, we pass that weather information to the structured chat function to get the baby activities.

<br>

Since our system prompt nicely lists these two tasks, we can let our user prompts be as simple as:

- `chat$chat("Execute Task 1 (get weather)")`
- `chat$chat_structured("Execute Task 2 (get baby activities)", type = data_model)`

## Let's see how that works

`examples/ellmer-tool-calling.R`

# ellmer + Shiny = 💜

*Because LLMs + tools + interactivity = endless possibilities*

## Shiny + ellmer

We don't need much to go from the R script to Shiny. Just a couple of technical changes:

- We want to use `chat_async()` and `chat_structured_async()`, to make requests non-blocking.
- Those async requests need to be executed within `ExtendedTask`

## Let's take a look
